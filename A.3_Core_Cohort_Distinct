-- Pulling out the first referrals of patients who have met the criteria
-- double check with Rob if we mean first referral as in coming from outside of SLAM
-- or is it any referrals that meet the criteria
-- Rob has viewed the document and I think we are fine with the 16K referrals. 
-- There is an easier way to do this by just taking the CoreCohort table and selecting
-- spell number 1.
-- I did it this way because i had to investigate why the unique referrals were not hte original 
-- 23K i thought it would be. It turned out that that those 23K while meeting my inclusion criteria
-- were not all 1st spells. So I had to select first spells...which resulted in teh following code. 
-- As i say it could have been done easier.
